# EzMojiBot
[EzMoji](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=828991138685517845&permissions=1074264128&scope=bot) is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot written in C# that can help users easily create their own emojis without ever needing to leave Discord.

## Features
To add emoji to discord server, users need to resize an image to max 256kb and go to server settings where they can 
add file and name by yourself. It isn't required right now. EzMoji can easily add new emoji just by typping 
">emoji [emojiname]" and attaching .jpg or .png file to message.
